# Circuit-guided acclimation of a synthetic bacterial consortium for improved conversion of alginate to a product

# Mathematical fitting-for-coculture
---------------------

mathematica notebook files (nb) and csv files with experimental data to replicate modeling results in presented in Supplementary Figure 9 of the paper.
Main folder : model for co-culture under various ampicillin concentration conditions.
Constitutive folder : model for consortia with the constitutive expression of bla.
nb and csv files should be in the same path.

## -Used experimental data for fitting
---------------------
 
 
    Main folder contains experimental data under ampicillin 0,5,10,20 ug/mL (Main text figure 4).
    Constitutive folder contains experimental data using PJ23100, PJ23109, PJ23112, PJ23119 promoters. The unit of all experimental data are converted to g/L.
    
    Vibrio.csv      : concentration of VDHG
    Ecoli.csv       : concentration of ECFHPG
    Alginate.csv    : concentration of alginate
    CSAlginate.csv  : concentration of consumed alginate by VDHG
    Acetate.csv     : concentration of acetate
    3HP.csv         : concentration of 3-HP
